# password-generator

## Description

This project involved using javaScript to create a webpage that generates a random password for a user. It takes several user inputs to define the password criteria, such as length and what types of characters to include. The code involved creating several functions that were called when the user clicks the generate button, that would produce promopts where the user selects their criteria for their password.

## Usage

When a user clicks on the generate button, they will see several prompts allowing them to set criteria for their password. Below are the prompts in the order they appear and what they do:

1. How long the password should be(between 10 and 64 characters)
2. If they want to include numbers in their password
3. If they want to include lowercase letters in their password
4. If they want to include uppercase letters in their password
5. If they want to include and special characters in their password

After the put their inputs, providing they are accepted it will either generate their password with their set criteria, or it will return a alert if no criteria is picked.
